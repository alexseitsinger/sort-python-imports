Keep your imports tidy!
This script allows you to sort python imports easlily.

Use :PyFixImports, command to fix imports in the beginning of currently edited file.                                                 
You can also use visual mode to select range of lines and then use <C-i> to sort imports in those lines.

Needs vim compiled with python support!
